# Data Products
This is my repo for the Data Science specialization, course data products starting Feb 2016.

##Assignment Scope:
The Shiny application in question is entirely up to the student (thats me). Make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.

##Shiny App  
https://dheerajagarwal.shinyapps.io/DataProductsSimpleShiny/ 

## App.R file?
This repo also contains a single app file with server and ui functions. However the app has not been tested and should not be used for evaluation.
